<h2> Project Aim </h2> 

Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the US dashboard
To rapidly monitor recent changes in mental health, the National Center for Health Statistics collected the data from April 23 to 2020 to October 26, 2020. The project aims to explore the mental health fluctuations among different demographic groups in the US to identify the most vulnerable categories and states over a proposed period of time. The findings of the proposed visualization might provide information about regions and demographic groups that need additional mental health and wellness resources to alleviate the symptoms of depression and anxiety.

<h3> MAIN RESULTS AND FINDINGS </h3>

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated mental health issues for many people, and anxiety has become the most common disorder associated with a constant feeling of worry. Data analysis and visualization results showed that

• The most prone to depression and anxiety states are Oregon, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, and New York. The pattern varied during different time periods. This result partially correlate with the number of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State (CDC COVID Data Tracker, 2020)

• The most vulnerable categories of people are 18-29 y.e. females. This finding confirmed previous studies exploring mental health issues among different groups. For example, Chakraborty (2020) mentioned demographic groups who tend toward greater anxiety. An online survey of 1,210 people conducted during the pandemic showed that females, students, and people with health problems are more affected by stress factors.

• The highest peaks of depression and anxiety were around late May and mid-July. The second peak in the summer also correlate with the second wave of COVID-19 in the US (Statista, 2020)
